# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Assignment Description
[Project Outline Assignment](https://education.launchcode.org/liftoff/modules/assignments/project-outline)

GroupMind / Gestalt

### Overview
Gestalt is a simple but powerful scheduling and project management application. Users, divided into Planners and Doers, create a single unified schedule that all users can access. Planners set schedules and assignments, which are then distributed to Doers via notifications and reading the group schedule. Both groups can interact via direct messaging between each other or by reading notices on the groups main page.

This idea originated on the office whiteboard, where scheduling was made. This was often a communal activity around which the office rotated. Field crews could check this board in the abscence of a project manager and know what was coming up the next day and after. Gestalt would model this, but instead of revolving around a physical board, would allow for a digital board that all team members can access from anywhere they are.

### Features
User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Users will have distinct functions based on their role. Managers will have more control but will have restricted access.
User Board: Users will be able to view a graphical user board that shows the upcoming schedule.
Board Manipulation: Managers will be able to post to the board, adding and deleting tasks and timelines.
Detail Expansion: Managers can add and view details within the main board tasks. Doers will be able to view these tasks, but not edit them.
User Messaging: Users will be able to message other users directly, in a basic chat functionality.

### Technologies
Java - website functionality functionality
Javascript (possibly) - website functionality
Spring Boot - website design
MySQL - database interaction
Hibernate - database interaction
Thymeleaf templates - website design
HMTL - website design
CSS - website design
JUnit - testing
GUI technology - AWT, JavaFX, Swing or similar - website design
Git - application database

### What I'll Have to Learn
For this project, I will have to learn how to build simple GUI's that are accessible by multiple individuals. I foresee databases being a significant portion of this project. Building an interactive board that is saved between all users at once is a significant challenge that will need to be overcome.
